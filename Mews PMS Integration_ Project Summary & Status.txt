Mews PMS Integration: Project Summary & Status
Date: August 12, 2025 Status: Core data adapters complete; architectural review pending.
This document summarizes the plan, technical details, and current progress for integrating the Mews Property Management System (PMS) into the Market Pulse application.
1.0 Integration Strategy
The core strategy is to build a dedicated Mews Adapter (/api/adapters/mewsAdapter.js) that acts as a "translator" between the Mews API and the Market Pulse application. This adapter is responsible for all Mews-specific logic, including authentication, API calls, and transforming Mews data into our application's standard data models. This approach ensures the core application remains PMS-agnostic.
2.0 Mews Connector API: Final Data Retrieval Plan
This section consolidates the final, validated research on how to interact with the Mews Connector API for our specific data needs.
2.1 Authentication & Environments
* Method: All API requests are HTTP POST with Content-Type: application/json.
* Tokens: Authentication (ClientToken, AccessToken) is included in the JSON body of every request.
* Environment: All development and testing uses the Mews Demo environment at https://api.mews-demo.com.
2.2 Key Endpoints & Data Mapping
* Hotel Configuration Details
   * Objective: Get a property's name, city, currency, timezone, and location.
   * Endpoint: configuration/get
   * Status: Complete and tested.
* Daily Occupancy Metrics (Rooms Sold & Hotel Capacity)
   * Objective: Get the total number of occupied rooms and the total number of available rooms for a given date range.
   * Endpoint: services/getAvailability (version 2024-01-22)
   * Logic: This single endpoint provides pre-calculated Occupied and ActiveResources metrics for each room category. The adapter sums these values across all categories to get a hotel-wide total for each day. This revised approach is more efficient and accurate than the initial plan of manual calculation.
   * Status: Complete and tested.
* Daily Revenue Metrics (Total Room Revenue)
   * Objective: Get the total room revenue, both net and gross of tax.
   * Endpoint: orderItems/getAll
   * Logic: The adapter filters for items with Type: 'SpaceOrder' to isolate room revenue. It sums the NetValue and GrossValue from the response to get both revenue figures. The function also handles pagination to ensure all data is retrieved.
   * Status: Complete and tested.
3.0 Development Log (Completed Work on August 12, 2025)
* Implemented getOccupancyMetrics function:
   * Successfully integrated with the services/getAvailability endpoint.
   * Resolved a critical API error (FirstTimeUnitStartUtc is not start of TimeUnit) by implementing a timezone correction based on the hotel's Europe/Budapest timezone.
   * Fixed a bug by correcting the response key from ResourceCategories to ResourceCategoryAvailabilities.
   * Verified functionality via the /api/admin/test-mews-occupancy test route.
* Implemented getRevenueMetrics function:
   * Successfully integrated with the orderItems/getAll endpoint.
   * Confirmed that filtering by Type: 'SpaceOrder' correctly isolates room revenue.
   * Confirmed that the API provides both NetValue and GrossValue, satisfying our data requirements for the proposed schema change.
   * Verified functionality via the /api/admin/test-mews-revenue test route.
* Confirmed getHotelDetails function:
   * The existing function using the configuration/get endpoint was verified as correct and sufficient for fetching hotel standing data.
   * Verified functionality via the /api/admin/test-mews-connection test route.
4.0 Next Steps: Proposed Architectural Enhancement
Based on the findings during the Mews integration, a significant architectural improvement is proposed to enhance the accuracy and performance of revenue reporting for all PMS integrations.
* The Problem: The current method of calculating tax on-the-fly for Cloudbeds hotels is inefficient and historically inaccurate if tax rates change.
* The Solution: Modify the database schema to store both net_revenue and gross_revenue for every daily snapshot. This makes reporting faster, ensures historical accuracy, and simplifies frontend logic.
Implementation Plan
1. Database Migration: Alter the daily_metrics_snapshots table to replace total_room_revenue with net_revenue and gross_revenue. Add a pricing_model column to the hotels table.
2. Backfill Historical Data: Create and run a one-time script to populate the new revenue columns for all existing Cloudbeds data.
3. Update Daily Sync Logic:
   * Cloudbeds: The sync job will now calculate and store both net and gross revenue.
   * Mews: The sync job will map NetValue to net_revenue and GrossValue to gross_revenue.
4. Update Reporting Page: The UI toggle will be simplified to switch between displaying the net_revenue and gross_revenue columns.
This architectural change is the next logical step before the Mews adapter can be fully integrated into the production data sync jobs.

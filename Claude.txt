I am going to upload a single file:

MarketPulse_Sentinel_MasterBlueprint.md

This file is the final, current, complete and authoritative blueprint of the Market Pulse + Sentinel system.

Treat this file as the only valid source of architecture truth.
Ignore all prior knowledge, memories, cached assumptions, or best-practice patterns.

🧠 WHEN THE FILE IS UPLOADED — FOLLOW THESE RULES EXACTLY
1. Read the entire file silently.

Do not summarise.
Do not rewrite.
Do not restate.
Do not interpret.
Do not extract bullet points.
Just read and load it into working memory.

When finished, respond with a single confirmation:

“Loaded.”

Nothing else.

2. After loading, follow the internal AI protocol inside the file

This includes:

Analyze First

Plan before writing code

Ask if anything is unclear

One-file-at-a-time

Find-and-replace modifications only

No full-file rewrites unless asked

Minimal comments

Strict non-hallucination

3. Never invent logic or fill gaps.

If the file does not define something: ask.
If something is ambiguous: ask.
If a field, endpoint, rule or table is missing: ask.

Do not use external conventions, assumptions, guesses, or previous architecture knowledge.

4. You must always produce a plan before code.

Plans should be short and action-oriented.
Wait for my approval before writing code.

5. Treat everything not in the file as invalid.

Ignore:

deprecated logic

old designs

historical ideas

imagined features

best-practice generalisations

Only what is explicitly written in the Master Blueprint is allowed.

✔ Your ONLY response after upload:

“Loaded.”

# Project Blueprint: Market Pulse UI/UX Redesign

**Last Updated:** October 16, 2025

## 1.0 Overview & Objective

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for migrating the entire Market Pulse application to a new, modern user interface based on a high-fidelity React prototype generated by Figma AI. The objective is to adopt this superior frontend technology to enhance user experience, while leveraging our existing stable backend API.

## 2.0 Core Migration Methodology: A Hybrid Architecture

We are officially adopting a **hybrid architecture**. The project will be split into two distinct parts: a React single-page application (SPA) for the frontend, and our existing Node.js Express server as a pure API backend. This approach replaces the previous, unsuccessful strategy of manually translating React components into Alpine.js.

* **Frontend (React SPA):** The fully functional React prototype exported from Figma will become the new user interface. It will be built into a set of static files and served by our backend.
* **Backend (Node.js API):** The existing application will be simplified to handle only API requests (`/api/*`), user authentication, and serving the static React frontend.

This strategy allows us to use the high-quality prototype directly while retaining our proven backend logic, minimizing risk and accelerating development.

### 2.1 Git & Deployment Strategy

Our Git and deployment workflow remains the same, ensuring a safe, isolated development environment.

* **Git Branch:** All work will be contained within the single `feature/ui-redesign` branch.
* **Vercel Previews:** Every `git push` to this branch will generate a live, shareable preview URL for testing and review, with zero impact on the production application.
* **Instant Rollback:** The production `main` branch will not be touched until the migration is complete and verified, guaranteeing safety and the ability to instantly roll back if needed.

## 3.0 Detailed Migration Plan

We will execute the migration in a phased approach, beginning with a Proof of Concept to validate the new architecture.

* **[ ] Phase 1: Proof of Concept - Architectural Integration**
    * [ ] **Build React App:** Compile the React prototype into static HTML/CSS/JS files using its `npm run build` command.
    * [ ] **Merge Frontend Files:** Move the static build output from the React project into the `/public` directory of the main Node.js project.
    * [ ] **Reconfigure `server.js`:** Modify the server to serve the React app's `index.html` for all main application routes (e.g., `/app/*`).
    * [ ] **Update `vercel.json`:** Add a build override command to automate the React build process during Vercel deployments.
    * [ ] **Verify Deployment:** Push changes to the feature branch and confirm the new React UI loads and successfully fetches data from the backend on the Vercel preview URL.

* **[ ] Phase 2: Full Implementation & Cleanup**
    * [ ] Once the PoC is verified, the React router will handle all page navigation. The migration is functionally complete at this point.
    * [ ] **Delete Obsolete Files:** Remove all legacy Alpine.js page files (`/public/app/*.html`) and logic files (`/public/app/*.mjs`, `/public/app/_shared/*.mjs`) that have been replaced by the React application.

* **[ ] Phase 3: Final Review & Merge**
    * [ ] Conduct a final, comprehensive review of the entire application via the Vercel Preview URL.
    * [ ] Open a Pull Request to merge `feature/ui-redesign` into `main`.
    * [ ] Merge and deploy the new design to production.
